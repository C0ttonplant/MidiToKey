    <B>Midi2Key</B>
    A quick and dirty program that I made to play games with my Midi keyboard.
    It can be used for macros, and key combinations.

    Add keybinds by pressing esc after entering your Midi device, and typing keybinds -note.
    A list of key codes can be found here: https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard
